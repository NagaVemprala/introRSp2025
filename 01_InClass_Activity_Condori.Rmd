## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#' This R script demonstrates handling data in R, various data structures  
#' available, and demonstrate vector operations    

# Creating vectors ----
# Q1. Create a vector named numbers containing the integers from 1 to 20.
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)

# Q2. Create a vector named names containing the following names: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Emily".
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Emily")

# Q3. Create a vector named mixed_data containing the following values: 10, "hello", TRUE, 3.14, 5i.
mixed_data <- c(10, "hello", TRUE, 3.14, 5i)

# Q4. Access the fourth element of the names vector created in Q2. 
print(names[4])

# Q5. Change the third element of the numbers vector created in Q1 to 30.
numbers[3] <- 30

# Creating Lists (Uses the objects created from questions Q1 to Q5) ----  
# Q6. Create a list named my_list containing the following elements:  
#         the vector numbers, the number 100, and the logical value TRUE.
my_list <- list(numbers, 100, TRUE)

# Q7. Access the first element of the my_list list.
my_list[[1]]

# Q8. Add a new element to the my_list list: the vector mixed_data from Q3.
my_list[[4]] <- mixed_data
